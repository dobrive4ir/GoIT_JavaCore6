1. Create classes User and Order.
    1.1) Class User should contains fields:
        long id;
        String firstName;
        String lastName;
        String City;
        int balance;
    1.2)Class Order should contains fields:
        long id;
        int price;
        Currency currency (use class Currency from module 4);
        String itemName;
        String shopIdentificator;
        User user;
2. Create Main class where you need to create 10 orders with 10 users and put it to the List and then:
    2.1) sort list by Order price in decrease order;
    2.2) sort list by Order price in increase order and User city;
    2.3) sort list by Order itemName and shopIdentificator and User city;
    Additional tasks:
    2.4) delete duplicates from the list;
    2.5) delete items where the price less then 1500;
    2.6) separate list for 2 lists - orders in USD and EUR;
    2.7) separate list for as many lists as many different cities it has;
3. Create Main class where you need to create 10 orders with 10 users and put it to the TreeSet. You should create 8
    unique and two duplicate orders and then:
    3.1) check if set contains order with user's lastName "Petrov";
    3.2) print order with largest price using only one TreeSet method;
    3.3) delete orders where currency is USD using Iterator;
4. Generate Integer and String ArrayList and LinkedList with 1000 and 10000 elements. Measure time of execution of the
    following methods and print it to console:
    4.1) add;
    4.2) set;
