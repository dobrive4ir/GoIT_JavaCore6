1. Create an enum class Country with a list of 5 or more random countries;
   Create utility class IdGenerator, that will generate and return a unique identifier (with your own implementation);
2. Create a Food class with the following fields:
    long id (unique product identifier);
    String name (name of the product);
    String country (manufacturer country);
    int expiration (expiry date in days amount);
   Implement access to fields. The id identifier must be unavailable for modification and generated by IdGenerator
    when instance of Food class is created;
   Products are considered identical if their id-fields are identical. Override methods hashCode and equals according
    to this condition;
3. Create universal interface IManageSystem<T> with following methods:
    T save(T obj, Double price);
    T save(T obj);
    void delete(T obj) ;
    void deleteById(long id);
    T get(long id);
    Double getPrice(T obj);
    Set<T> getProducts();
    List<Double> getPrices();
4. Implement IManageSystem interface for working with the products database. Class must contain field
    Map<Food, Double> database. This field emulates database, contains data about the products and their prices. Field
    must be available only within this class;
5. Check all the operation of Manage System in the main(){} method (use 5 or more Food class instances);
6. Additional: add following methods to the IManageSystem<T> interface, implement them and check in main(){} method:
    void printProductsSortedByName() (prints the list "product-price", sorted by the products names);
    void printProductsSortedByPrice() (prints the list "product-price", sorted by the products prices in increase order).
