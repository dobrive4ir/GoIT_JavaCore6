1. Use structures from module7 homework (User and Order) and complete next tasks, using Java8 instruments:
    1.1) sort list by Order price in decrease order;
    1.2) sort list by Order price in increase order and User city;
    1.3) sort list by Order itemName and shopIdentificator and User city;
    1.4) delete duplicates from the list;
    1.5) delete items where the price less then 1500;
    1.6) separate list for 2 lists - orders in USD and EUR;
    1.7) separate list for as many lists as many different cities it has;
    1.8) check if set contains order with user's lastName "Petrov";
    1.9) delete orders where currency is USD;
    Restrictions:
    - you can not use an Iterator;
    - you can not use loops;
    Define each task to individual method
2. Create class with main(){} method and test all tasks.
